# PlayerStatsTesting
This is a test project to introduce myself to minecraft plugin development.

My overall goals for this project are to become familiar with spigot api, yaml files, and minecraft metadata. 
Its main focus will be on creating a dynamic player stat system similar to what you would see in a standard rpg. 
This will be done by creating a dynamic system that can read and write metadata to yml files based on an object's class and unique identifiers.
